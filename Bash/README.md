**Welcome to my Bash scripting learning repository!**

## **What This Repository Covers**  
This repo documents my journey into the world of Bash scripting, I'll be workking through various tasks and challenges to learn and share my understanding of Bash scripting 

---

## **Projects and Examples**  
Here are some examples of what youâ€™ll find in this repository:  

- Creation a directory named Arena and then inside it, create three files: `warrior.txt`, `mage.txt`, and `archer.txt`. List the contents of the Arena directory. 
- Creation of a script that outputs the numbers 1 to 10, one number per line.
- A script that checks if a file named hero.txt exists in the Arena directory. If it does, print `Hero found!`; otherwise, print `Hero missing!`.
- Creattion of a script that copies all `.txt` files from the `Arena` directory to a new directory called `Backup`.
- Write a script that:
  1. Creates a directory names `Battlefield
  2. Inside Battlefield, create files named `knight.txt`, `sorcerer.txt`, and `rogue.txt`.
  3. Check if `knight.txt` exists; if it does, move it to a new directory called `Archive`.
  4. List the contents of both `Battlefield` and `Archive`.
- A script that accepts a filename as an argument and prints the number of lines in that file. If no filename is provided, display a message saying `No file provided`.
- A script that sorts all `.txt` files in a directory by their size, from smallest to largest, and displays the sorted list.
- A script that searches for a specific word or phrase across all `.log` files in a directory and outputs the names of the files that contain the word or phrase.
- A script that monitors a directory for any changes (file creation, modification, or deletion) and logs the changes with a timestamp.
- Write a script that:
  1. Creates a directory called `Arena_Boss`.
  2. Creates 5 text files inside the directory, named `file1.txt` to `file5.txt`.
  3. Generates a random number of lines (between 10 and 20) in each file.
  4. Sorts these files by their size and displays the list.
  5. Checks if any of the files contain the word `Victory`, and if found, moves the file to a directory called `Victory_Archive`.
- A script that checks the disk space usage of a specified directory and sends an alert if the usage exceeds a given threshold.
- A script that reads a configuration file in the format `KEY=VALUE` and prints each `key-value pair`.
- A script that backs up a directory to a specified location and keeps only the last 5 backups.
- An interactive script that presents a menu with options for different system tasks (e.g., check disk space, show system uptime, list users), and executes the chosen task.
- A script that presents a menu to the user with the following options:
  1. Check disk space
  2. Show system uptime
  3. Backup the Arena directory and keep the last 3 backups
  4. Parse a configuration file settings.conf and display the values
  5. Execute the chosen task.
