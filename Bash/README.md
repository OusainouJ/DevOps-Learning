Here are some examples of what youâ€™ll find in this repository:  

- Create a directory named Arena and then inside it, create three files: warrior.txt, mage.txt, and archer.txt. List the contents of the Arena directory. 
- Create a script that outputs the numbers 1 to 10, one number per line.
- Write a script that checks if a file named hero.txt exists in the Arena directory. If it does, print Hero found!; otherwise, print Hero missing!.
- Create a script that copies all .txt files from the Arena directory to a new directory called Backup.
- Write a script that:
  1. Creates a directory names 'Battlefield'
  2. Inside Battlefield, create files named knight.txt, sorcerer.txt, and rogue.txt.
  3. Check if knight.txt exists; if it does, move it to a new directory called Archive.
  4. List the contents of both Battlefield and Archive.
- Write a script that accepts a filename as an argument and prints the number of lines in that file. If no filename is provided, display a message saying 'No file provided'.
- Write a script that sorts all .txt files in a directory by their size, from smallest to largest, and displays the sorted list.
- Create a script that searches for a specific word or phrase across all .log files in a directory and outputs the names of the files that contain the word or phrase.
